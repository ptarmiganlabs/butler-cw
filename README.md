CW = Cache Warming, i.e. the process of proactively forcing Sense apps to be loaded into RAM, so they are readily available when users open them. Butler CW does this for Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows (QSEoW).

## Background

Many years ago Qlik Sense Enterprise (the Windows Server version, which was the only one available at the time) moved to something called "[shared persistence](http://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/3.2/Subsystems/Installation/Content/InstallationLicensing/Install-Shared.htm)". It simply means that the Sense apps are stored on a central file server, rather than on each individual server in the Sense environment.  
Shared persistence is today the only supported storage model for QSEoW.

The upside of shared persistence is that there is a single version of each app - the one stored on the central file server.

The downside is that when a user opens a large Sense app, it takes significant time to load the app from the file server into Qlik's associative engine (a.k.a. the QIX engine) of the server that the user is connected to.

True, the load time will depend on things like how fast disks are used on the file server, network speed etc - but even with best possible disks and servers that Amazon, Google or Microsoft offer in their cloud platforms, large apps might take several minutes to load into the engine. This means the user opening the app in question would have to wait that time before starting to use the app. Not a good user experience.

## Solution

Butler CW consists of three main parts:

* Standalone binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS. All binaries are scanned for virus and malware. The Windows and macOS binaries are signed using industry standard methods. There is also a Docker image.
* Config file (YAML format) used by the Butler CW binary.
* A separate config file (YAML) for specifying with what frequency what apps should be loaded into which servers.

## Features

* Control when and on what Sense server specific apps should be loaded/cache warmed.
* Very flexible, human readable cache warming schedule definition for each app. Choose between using UTC or other local time zones.
* Control per app if all sheets in the app should be opened. If enabled, this will effectively pre-calculate all charts in all sheets, for the default selection state in the app. This can dramatically shorten load times when an app is first accessed by end users.
* Apps can be configured to have an initial cache warming run when Butler CW is first started.
* Heartbeats sent to infrastructure monitoring tools. Useful if you want to monitor and ensure Butler CW is alive and well.
* Uptime metrics (how long Butler CW has been running, how much memory it's using etc) written to log files.
* Send data about all cache warming runs, for all apps, to MQTT for later use by subscribers of the MQTT topics.
* Store the app schedule file in GitHub or in a file on disk.
* Logs written to disk and console, with configurable log levels. Choose between using CET or local time zones in log files.
* ... and more. The main config file is well documented and serves as the ultimate list of what's available in terms of features.

## Command line options

Butler CW has a few settings that can be configured via the command line:

```powershell
PS C:\code\butler-cw> .\butler-cw.exe --help
Usage: butler-cw [options]

Butler CW makes sure that the most important apps are always loaded in your Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows environment.
CW = Cache Warming, i.e. the  process of proactively forcing Sense apps to be loaded into RAM memory.

Options:
  -V, --version                 output the version number
  -c, --config-file <file>      Path to config file (default: "production.yaml")
  -l, --log-level <level>       log level (choices: "error", "warn", "info", "verbose", "debug", "silly", default: "info")
  -a, --app-config-file <file>  Path to config file with cache warming definitions
  -h, --help                    display help for command
PS C:\code\butler-cw>
```

## Configuration files

There are two config files:

### Main config file

This YAML file contains general config info that Butler CW needs.

Part of the information is sensitive, for example the location of the Sense server certificates used when connecting to the Sense servers, as well as other parameters used to run the actual cache warming service. This file is stored on local disk.

The default name and location for this file is `production.yaml` in the same directory where the Butler CW binary resides.  
If the config file is located and/or names something else the  `--config-file` command line option can be used to specify which config file to use.

### Cache warming definitions file

This YAML file contains data about which apps should be cache warmed, on what servers and how often.

The config file's location is either specified using the `--app-config-file` command line option or in the `appConfig.diskConfigFile` setting in the main config file.

Most likely there will be several people (Sense developers and admins) that need to edit this file.  
For that reason this file can be stored either on local disk or on GitHub or some other GitHub-compatible revision control system.

If stored on GitHub (or other similar system), Butler CW will read the config file from there and you will get all the traceability and peer review capabilities offerd by GitHub.

The workflow looks like this:

1. Sense developers that want their apps pre-loaded onto Sense servers fork the GitHub repository where the YAML config file lives.
2. The developer make some additions to the YAML config file and send a pull request to the upstream repository (which is managed by the Sense admins).
3. When the changes are accepted in the upstream/main Git repository, Butler CW will at next restart use the new config file.

There are instructions in [the template file](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-cw/blob/master/config/apps_config.yaml) included in the GitHub repo that explains how this file works.

## MQTT support

[MQTT](https://mqtt.org) is a lightweight, robust, publish-subscribe (pub-sub) protocol used in the IoT sector and elsewhere.
It's very easy to use and makes it trivial to send data from one source system to any number of destination systems ("subscribers") that are interested in this particular data.

Butler CW can be configured to send a MQTT message every time an app is cache warmed.  
The configuration is done in the `mqttConfig` section of the main config file:

```YAML
# MQTT config parameters
mqttConfig:
  out: 
    enable: true              # Should info about cache run/warming events be sent as MQTT messages?
    baseTopic: butler-cw/     # Topic to send cache run events to. Should end with /
    tzFormat: UTC             # LOCAL or UTC. Default is UTC
  broker:                     # MQTT server/broker config
    uri: mqtt://<MQTT server ip/FQDN>:<port>      ## Port is usually 1883
```

## Installation and setup

### Running as a stand-alone binary

Basically the same as for any app in the [Butler family](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs):

1. Grab the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-cw/releases).  
   Extract it to a suitable place on your Windows/Linux/Mac computer. A place like `d:\tools\butler-cw` could make sense on a Windows Server with a system `c:` drive and a `d:` for non-system applications.
2. Copy the template config files ([here](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-cw/blob/master/config/default_config.yaml) and [here](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-cw/blob/master/config/apps_config.yaml)) to desired location, for example a `config` subdirectory.  
   Rename them as you see fit, for example `production.yaml` and `apps.yaml`.
3. Edit `./config/production.yaml` as needed, using paths etc specific to your local system.
4. Edit `./config/apps.yaml`, specifying when Sense apps should be loaded into servers.  
   The frequency field in this config file is quite flexible, you can use any format listed [here](https://bunkat.github.io/laterparsers.htm).

Note:
>  The `appStepThroughSheets` field in `./config/apps.yaml` controls whether Butler CW should iterate through all sheets and chart objects in the app.  
>  If enabled, and there are lots of sheets and charts, **a lot** of RAM might be used when loading the app into Sense's engine.  
>  
> The user experience will on the other hand be great - sheets and the charts on them will load instantly - even those charts that previosuly took long time to render due to complex calculations and/or large data volumes.  
> 
> It is impossible to give firm guidance on what levels of caching and stepping through sheet that is suitable - you have to start on a low level and work your way up until you find a solution that works in your Qlik Sense environment.

Start Butler CW by running `.\butler-cw.exe --config-file .\config\production.yaml --app-config-file .\config\apps.yaml`.  
Here we are using PowerShell on Windows, specifying the location of the config files using the `--config-file` and `--app-config-file` command line options.

### Running as a Windows service

Use the excellent [nssm](https://nssm.cc) tool to install Butler CW as a service.

Instructions are available on the nssm site.

### Running in a Docker container

If you have access to a Docker or Kubernetes environment this is a good option for running Butler CW.

* Make use of your existing container infrastructure, or use those offered by Amazon, Google, Microsoft etc.
* Benefit from the extremely comprehensive tools ecosystem (monitoring, deployment etc) that is available for Docker/Kubernetes.
* Updating Butler CW to the latest version is as easy as stopping the container, then doing a "docker pull ptarmiganlabs/butler:latest", and finally starting the container again.

Installing and getting started with Butler CW in Docker can look something like this when working on MacOS. Windows and Linux of course looks slightly different.

Create a directory for Butler CW. Config files and logs will be stored here.

```bash
proton:code goran$ mkdir -p butler-cw-docker/config/certificate
proton:code goran$ mkdir -p butler-cw-docker/log
proton:code goran$ cd butler-cw-docker
proton:butler-cw-docker goran$
```

* Copy the two YAML config files from the GitHub repository, rename and edit them as described above and place them in the ./config directory.
* Copy `docker-compose.yml` from the GitHub repository to the main directory.
* Export certifiates from the QMC in Qlik Sense Enterprise, place them in the config/certificate directory.

Let's do this one step at a time.  
What files are there?

```bash
proton:butler-cw-docker goran$ ls -la

What does a real-world config file look like?  
Here's one for Docker (the only difference is how the certificate files are referenced.)

```bash
proton:butler-cw-docker goran$ cat config/production.yaml
# Rename this file to production.yaml, and fill in data as needed below.

Warning: Setting the log level to debug in the config file will create **lots** of log output.

Finally, let's take a look at what Docker tells us about the currently running containers:

```
âžœ  ~ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                    PORTS     NAMES
565152b1be90   ptarmiganlabs/butler-cw:latest   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 20 seconds (healthy)             butler-cw
âžœ  ~
```

Great, Butler CW is running and reporting a healthy status. All good!

### Storing configuration in Git

While a good idea, this is a slightly complex topic.

Different revision control tools and services (Github, BitBucket etc) work in slightly different ways when it comes to allowing access to files.

In public Github (GH), it is for example possible to read files in public repositories without being logged into Github.

In Github Enterprise (GHE) on the other hand, each company can configure whether their own employees should be able to read files from GHE repositories without being logged into GHE, or whether such access requires the user to be logged into GHE.

Bottom line is that Butler CW in current version logs into GH or GHE, and then read the `apps.yaml` file. The rationale is that most companies will not place their config files on public GH, but rather in GHE or other privat revision control system that require login.

It is worth noting that Butler CW can quite easily be extended to support other revision control tools/solutions.

## Remember!

You cannot pre-load all apps. Focus on a few of the most used apps, and/or some of the biggest ones, where the impact of cache warming will be the greatest.  
Also, remember to do an occasional review what apps are being used, and if needed adjust the cach warming strategy. No point in forcing apps that only a few people use into RAM.

## Strange stuff, caveats and things not quite working (yet)

The projects [issue list](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/butler-cw/issues) is where bugs and feature requests should go, but there can also be things that aren't really bugs, but still don't work quite as you might expect.. Maybe they will go onto the bug list at some point - TBD.

* If the config setting `scheduler.showNextEvent.enable` is enabled, Butler will right after doing a cache run show when the *next* cache run will take place.  
  This can be nice if you want to ensure that the schedule you created works as expected.  
  **The caveat is**: For the *first* cache run it sometimes displays an incorrect time for the *second* schedule run.
  Maybe it should be classified as a bug.. but it looks like it's tricky to fix, and the impact is really quite minor as it only affects what's shown in the logs right after Butler CW is started.

### Inspiration

Inspiration to this project largely came from Joe Bickley's [Cache Initializer](https://github.com/JoeBickley/CacheInitializer) project.  
At the core Joe's tool does the same as Butler CW, but for individual apps.
  
I wanted a stand-alone tool that by itself handles multiple apps on multiple servers. Also, as the rest of the Butler suite is written in Node.js, I wanted the cache warmer to use the same underlying tech as the rest of the Butler family.

Joe's tool does one thing Butler CW does not do: Allow filters to be applied when opening the app. This is a useful feature and might be included in future versions of Butler CW.
